## Motivation
Recently, I clean installed my computer and forgot to backup all atom's awesome packages. This really make me sad because I need to install all of them by each and I might miss some of them. :cry::cry::cry:

However, no more missing packages since I finally have these scripts. :tada::fireworks::lollipop:
